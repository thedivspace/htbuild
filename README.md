<hr>


#### Hard things made easy!

htBuild is a framework developed by Divspace. This is the first version of htBuild released in 2021. You need not to install a new tool which in turn forces you to install a programming language you donâ€™t use. 

This easy-to-use framework written in JavaScript, lets you use variables and components in your projects in a very easy method. Feel free to change anything according to your tastes, no need to master much complex framework and/or terms and activities. 

### What's htBuild?

htBuild is a framework that allows user to use variables, components and libraries making a coder's task comprehensible. It does *not* requires you to learn a very complex framework and/ or terms and activities. Since dynamic sites require cloud for deployment, here, static site do not need cloud. htBuild provides **Zero Byte of Deployment** in order to save your storage space on server.

Front-end Developers' life made easy, yet simpler than ever before

### Usage

* #### Component 

  Why to use components? 

  => When you code a "repetitive-element" used in the site, the main code expands. Hence, in this scenario, htbuild component proves useful. You create a component file, call/import it into your main code once, or 'n' number of times; thus, keeps your code precise and readable for anyone.

  **Here's how to create an htBuild Component:**

  â€‹		First, create a file in  ``\components\`` directory with ``component_name.html``
  â€‹		Then add your component html code in it. 

  â€‹		Following is the usage of component to use in your code:

  ```html
  <!-- Using Component -->
  <ht-component data-component="/component_name"/>
  ```

* #### Global Variable

  A global variable is a variable with global scope, hence accessible throughout the program, unless shadowed.

  â€‹	Define a global variable in your code:

  ```json
  {
      "[global_variable_name]": "[global_variable_value]"
  }
  ```

  â€‹	Refer the following to use a global variable in your code:

  ```html
  <!-- Using Variable -->
  <h1>Welcome, {{[global_variable_name]}} </h1>
  ```

* #### Local Variable 

  Like components, variables can be used whenever and wherever you desire and helps increasing your code performance and readability.

  â€‹	Define a local variable in your code:

  ```html
  <!-- Defining Variable -->
  <ht-variable data-var"[variable_name]" data-val="[variable_value]"/>
  ```

  â€‹	Refer the following to use a local variable:

  ```html
  <!-- Using Variable -->
  <h1>Welcome, {{[variable_name]}} </h1>
  ```

  [Click here](https://htbuild.thedivspace.com/docs/#/variables) for detailed guidelines to create, update and use <b>local variables</b> in your code.

  

* #### Live Server

  htBuild has live server which allows any updates in your file to display in real-time in your browser without refresh.
