  "description": "htBuild is a framework developed by Divspace. This is the first version of htBuild released in 2021. You need not to install a new tool which in turn forces you to install a programming language you donâ€™t use. htBuild is an easy-to-use static site framework written in JavaScript. It lets you use variables and components in static site in a very easy method. Feel free to change anything according to your tastes, no need to master much complex framework and/or terms and activities.",
